We used a starter build with Php and written is es6. The base structure was pretty simple but we had to add a lot of effects. Animations on mouse movement for the homepage, parallaxe effect in the case studies and adapting a PixiJs scripts to handle the distortion effect. The main difficulty was to make all our animations and special effects works together without breaking performances.",

The design was already defined and with my friend Benjamin, we had to develop a managable website so that the team responsible for the site could add news, update teams members or the latest results. I setted up the project and was in charge of the pages: team, single news and news archives. I had to code a custom slider with two active items and custom transitions. The main difficulty was on the archive page (like always in wordpress) that use ajax calls to switch between all the news montly and yearly.",

			"description": "As a big 3d year project in Hetic, we had our first real client (excluding freelance of course). For my team it was Synerg'Hetic the school junior enterprise. Since they aready had a corporate website, we had to find another idea to highlight the greatest value of Synerg'hetic, its students and their creativity. They call themselves the 'web children' or 'Enfants du web' in french, we took it literally... We personified each student with a small baby, defined by its main skill (we ask student directly to get all our datas). It was the occasion for us to use React. The other developer handled the board movement and the form while I was in charge of the baby placement and all the interactions.",
